 * behavior(methods)
 * }
 * 
 * The process of binding data and corresponding methods into single unit is Encapsulation
 * If any component follows "Data Hiding" and "Abstraction" such type of component said to be encapsulated component

 * the main advantage of encapsulation are 
 * we can achieve security
 * enhancement is easy
 * improves maintainability of application
 * 
 * The maina advantage of encapsulation is we can achieve security but main disadvantage of encapsulation is it increases length of code and slows down execution
