/*
 * Outside person can't access our internal data directly or our internal data should not go outside directly.This OOP feature is nothing but Data Hiding.
 * After validation outside person can access our internal data. Ex.: After providing proper user name and password we can access our gmail information.
 * Even though we r valid customer of bank , we can able to access our info, and we can't access other's account info.
 * By declaring data variable as Private we can achieve Data Hiding.
 * 
 * public class Account{
 * private double balance;
 * 
 * public double getBalance(){
 *validation
 *return balance
 * }
 * }
 * 
 * The main advantage of data hiding is security.
 * 
 * It is highly recommend data member as private.
