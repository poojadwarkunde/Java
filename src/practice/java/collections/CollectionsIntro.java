/* 
 * Disadvantages of Array :
 * 		Fixed in Size
 * 		Homogeneous
 * 		Not useful where memory requirements is crucial
 * 		Performance is good
 * 		There is no underlying data structure, need to write methods for all the requirements
 * 		Can create array for Primitive and Objects
 * 		
 * To overcome above problem we should use Collections
 * 		Collections are growable
 * 		Collections can hold homogeneous and heterogeneous elements
 * 		Every collection class is implemented based on some standard data structure, for every requirement ready made method support is available
 * 		Useful when memory requirement is crucial
 * 		Performance wise collections are not recommended over array
 * 		Can create only object type collections i.e. Integer,Float,String,Double
 * 
 * Collection : 
 * 			Collection is a group of individual objects as single entity
 * 
 * Collection Framework :
 * 			contains several classes and interfaces which can be used to represent the group of individual objects as single entity
